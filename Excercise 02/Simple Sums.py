# Exercise Simple Sums allows student to learn how to preform calculations by means of variables. It helps to make code arranged, and add more readability to it.
# It allows student to preform calculations of two variables inside of another variable, that allows to make code shorter and simple.
# First Integer.
Integer1 = 8
# Second Integer.
Integer2 = 10
# The Variable where the calculation is preformed of First and Second Variables where the Integers are stored.
Addition = (Integer1 + Integer2)
# The output of the Variable where the sum of two variables are stored.
print(Addition)
